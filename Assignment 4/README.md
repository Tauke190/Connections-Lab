# Graph of people who has bachelor degree in USA #

## D3.js ##
Here , I have used D3.js library for creating complex SVG images. The SVG utlizes the JSON formatted data called topoJSON. IT is a JSON file specially designed
for encoding geographical co-ordinates efficiently.It also utlizes Fetch API to retrieve the data from the URL endpoint.Then using function from D3.js , I have drawn the co-ordinates and filled it with colors.
It also uses another JSON file which has the information regarding the Education level of people and their location. So I have combined this data set to create 
a data visualization of the graph 


## Things I learned ##
1. About D3.js and Integrating SVG vectors into the HTML easily
2. About topoJSON and how it can be used to encode geographical co-ordinates
3. Learned about javascript functions and objects



## Final Results ##
